        "textFirst": "An insurance premium is the amount you pay to your insurance company for your policy. Premiums can
        be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on the terms of your policy and your agreement with the
        insurer.",
        "titleSecond": "What is a coverage limit?",
        "textSecond": "A coverage limit is the maximum amount an insurance company will pay for a covered loss under
        your policy. Different types of coverage within a policy may have different limits.",
        "titleThird": "How does a deductible work?",
        "textThird": "A deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. For
        example, if you have a $500 deductible and incur a $2,000 claim, you will pay the first $500, and your insurer
        will cover the remaining $1,500.",
        "titleFourth": "What is a rider in insurance?",
        "textFourth": "A rider is an additional provision or amendment to an insurance policy that adds, modifies, or
        removes coverage. Riders allow you to customize your policy to better fit your specific needs.",
        "titleFifth": "How does insurance underwriting work?",
        "textFifth": "Insurance underwriting is the process by which an insurer evaluates the risk of insuring a person
        or entity and determines the terms of the insurance policy, including the premium. Underwriters assess factors
        such as age, health, occupation, and lifestyle to determine the level of risk."
