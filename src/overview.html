        "titleFirst": "What is the purpose of insurance?",
        "textFirst": "Insurance provides financial protection against unexpected events or losses. It helps individuals
        and businesses manage risks by transferring the financial burden to the insurance company in exchange for
        regular premium payments",
        "titleSecond": "How do I choose the right insurance policy?",
        "textSecond": "Choosing the right insurance policy involves assessing your specific needs, comparing quotes from
        different providers, and reading customer reviews. It’s important to understand the terms, coverage options, and
        any exclusions in the policy.",
        "titleThird": "What factors affect my insurance premium?",
        "textThird": "Several factors can influence your insurance premium, including your age, health, driving record,
        location, and the type and amount of coverage you choose. Each type of insurance has its own set of variables
        that affect premiums.",
        "titleFourth": "How do I file an insurance claim?",
        "textFourth": "To file an insurance claim, contact your insurance provider as soon as possible after the
        incident. Provide all necessary documentation, such as police reports, medical records, or repair estimates.
        Your insurer will guide you through the process and help you get the compensation you are entitled to.",
        "titleFifth": "What is a deductible?",
        "textFifth": "A deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. For
        example, if you have a $500 deductible and a claim for $2,000, you will pay the first $500, and your insurance
        will cover the remaining $1,500. Higher deductibles usually mean lower premiums, and vice versa."
