        "titleFirst": "How often should I review my insurance policy?",
        "textFirst": "It's advisable to review your insurance policy annually or whenever you experience a significant
        life event, such as buying a new home, getting married, or having a child. Regular reviews ensure your coverage
        remains adequate and up-to-date.",
        "titleSecond": "What is the difference between term and whole life insurance?",
        "textSecond": "Term life insurance provides coverage for a specified period, typically 10, 20, or 30 years, and
        pays a benefit only if the insured dies during that term. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, offers
        lifelong coverage and includes a savings component that can accumulate cash value over time.",
        "titleThird": "Can I have multiple insurance policies?",
        "textThird": "Yes, you can have multiple insurance policies. Many people carry several types of insurance (e.g.,
        health, auto, home, life) to cover different aspects of their lives. It's important to ensure that your coverage
        is coordinated to avoid gaps or overlaps.",
        "titleFourth": "What is a policy exclusion?",
        "textFourth": "A policy exclusion is a provision within an insurance policy that eliminates coverage for certain
        risks, events, or conditions. Understanding exclusions is crucial, as it helps you know what is not covered by
        your policy and allows you to plan accordingly.",
        "titleFifth": "How does a no-claims bonus work?",
        "textFifth": "A no-claims bonus is a discount offered by insurers to policyholders who have not made any claims
        during a specified period, usually a year. This bonus can significantly reduce your premium, rewarding you for
        being a low-risk customer."
